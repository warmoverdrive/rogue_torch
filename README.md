# "Rogue Torch"
> CS50 Final Project // Using Unity 2019.4.11f1

### [ItchIO Page](https://warmoverdrive.itch.io/rogue-torch) // *(Windows Only)*

## Learning Goals for this project:
This project started with a set of goals as follows:
* Produce a full Minimum Viable Product from scratch in ~2 weeks
* Explore basic procedural generation algorithms
* Make a fun game on the theme "Pass the Torch" (Weekly Game Jam 168)

Due to external factors, as well as a general over-scoping of what would be entailed in producing a product meeting my personal standards, this project has extended well past two weeks worth of work. However, I feel that the learning goals I had set out for initially have been met, and have learned a great deal about more complicated C# scripting and OOP principles as a whole. Ultimately, though this project has gone from an estimated 14 days to ~2 months, I feel the end product will be a solid execution of concept in a prototype, that has admittedly been more challenging than anticipated to complete.

### Features:
* Procedurally generated levels using Breadth First Search algorithm
* Ability to feed the generator a seed
* Raycast collision/entity detection
* Runtime configuration menu for the generation algorithm

### Possible Future Improvements:
Subject to my motivation to continue the project beyond the prototype stage:
* Improve performance by selectively activating actors based on proximity to the player
* More content (enemy types, bosses, biomes)
* Better VFX (particle FX for player feedback)
* Configurable Controls Menu
* Gold or some additional score method
* Difficulty Settings

### Utilizes External Packages:
* Cinemachine
* Universal Rendering Pipeline
* [2D Extras](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/2d-extras) *(included)*
